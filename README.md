# SOL-scalping-bot
Programmed SOL scalping bots that carry out trades each time there are possibilities meaning that it means a series of basic strategies to recognize major selling and purchase points to maximize returns.
how to comprehend SOL-USD Trading Bot (sol_bot.py)
This script (sol_bot.py) is a backtesting bot that is designed to perform the most basic trading strategy on Solana (SOL-USD) using historical data. It does not actually execute real trades or communicate with live exchanges, though — instead, it lets us experiment with a strategy against historical prices to see how it would have performed. As a starter bot for algorithmic trading or finance programming, this is a wonderful example of integrating technical indicators, risk management, and rational decision-making in a way that's easy to understand.

What This Bot Actually Does
Let's assume you have $10,000 and you want to buy and sell Solana strategically, not haphazardly. That is what this bot performs. It looks at past price action to decide:
When to purchase SOL (because the trend appears fine)
When to sell SOL (because you've either achieved a decent profit or have to minimize your losses)
Finally, it shows you how much you'd have, how many trades you "won" (positive), and how many you lost. You're not going for perfection — you're going for the logic behind automated trading decisions.
Where the Data Comes From
The bot fetches 6 months of hourly SOL-USD price data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library. This is the closing price of every hourly candle, and this is the basis of all our decisions to trade.
Technical Indicators Used
The bot blends two well-known indicators:
Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
Imagine this as a "smoothed" price over time.
The bot works with two SMAs:
Short SMA = average of the last 10 hours
Long SMA = 40-hour average
When the short SMA crosses over the long SMA, it is an indication of an uptrend.
Relative Strength Index (RSI)
RSI measures momentum: is the price rising too fast?
RSI is between 0 and 100. The bot will only buy when RSI is above 67, that is, strong momentum.
This eliminates weak or false signals.
So, the bot buys both:
Short SMA breaks above long SMA (trend starts)
RSI > 67 (there is high momentum)

Risk Management: Stop-Loss and Take-Profit
The moment a position is opened (i.e., we "buy SOL"), the bot enforces two simple rules:
If price drops 1% from what we bought → Stop Loss (we close to save capital)
If price goes up 5% → Take Profit (we lock profits)
This keeps the bot in line. It doesn't "hope" things get better — it grabs profit in a hurry and gets out of loss quickly.

Simulating the Trades
The script goes through each hourly candle in the data:
If strategy conditions are met and we don't own SOL → it "buys"
If we own SOL → it looks for:
Are we 1% in the red? Get out.
Are we 5% in the green? Get out.
Each time a trade is opened or closed, the bot logs the trade details like time and price.
On simulation end, the bot calculates:
Your final portfolio value
Your total profit or loss
Your total return (%)
Your win rate: winners vs losers number of trades

Example Output
After running, you should get something like this:

???? SOL Strategy Performance:
Final Value: $10,742.00
Profit: $742.00
Return: 7.42%
Win Rate: 66.67% (4 wins / 6 trades)
This translates to you starting with $10,000 and, by using this strategy for the past 6 months, you would have had $10,742 — not bad for a simple rule-based system.

Why This Strategy Makes Sense (Even for Beginners)
This bot does two very important things:
It deconstructs trading into rules.
No guesswork. No emotional trading.
Just pure logic: "if X and Y, then buy; if Z happens, then sell."
It manages risk appropriately.
Real traders don't win every time — they take care of their capital.
This bot illustrates that small, regular wins can accumulate when you reduce your losses quickly.

What You Can Learn From This Bot
How to use Python for financial data analysis
How to use and backtest technical indicators
How to simulate real trading behavior without risking real money
How even simple strategies can produce structured, testable output

????Next Steps You Could Try
If you would like to add or expand this bot:
Add more indicators like MACD or Bollinger Bands
Try out different stop-loss / take-profit percentages
Export trade history to a CSV file
Plot trades on a chart using matplotlib library
Build a live trading version (with real broker APIs)

Final Thoughts
sol_bot.py is a wonderful example of programming and trading in balance. It does not give you overnight wealth — but it does show that good common sense, smart filtering, and risk management can form the basis of a decent trading system. If you're a student, enthusiast, or wanna-be quant, this's a good starting point.
If you're able to read this code, tweak it, and check the result — you're already ahead of the game compared to most people trying to speculate on emotions or YouTube guesswork.
